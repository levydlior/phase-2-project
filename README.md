# Improvments for future
The general work was amazing and great. A few things we could've done better:
    <ul>
    <li>Naming of variables - a few times we got confused since out variable names were not accurate.</li>
    <li>Refactoring - Even though we used the components we made in different locations (as component should be used), we did repeat some of our code a few times.</li>
    <li>Cleaner Code - this connects to the first two. Having a cleaner code would've allowed us to work more efficently and encounter less problems.</li>
    </ul>
